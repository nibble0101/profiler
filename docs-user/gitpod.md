Instead of configuring a local set-up, you can also use gitpod, an online continuous development environment  with minimum set-up.
To use gitpod, you can login using your gitHub account and then follow the steps below.

- Change the URL of your browser to the origin or upstream repository e.g. `https://github.com/firefox-devtools/profiler.git`. 
- Prefix the URL in the address bar of your browser with `gitpod.io/#` e.g. `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/firefox-devtools/profiler.git`
- You can also install the [gitpod browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/) instead of prefixing the URL of your browser with `gitpod.io/#` as described above.
- The browser extension, if you choose to install, will add a button on each repository on Github. Clicking the button will trigger creation of an automatic gitpod set-up. Take note you will have to authorize access to your gitHub account if it is your first time.
- Gitpod will then clone the repository and launch a workspace for you
